# **Dr.Sim: Similarity learning for transcriptional phenotypic drug discovery**  
## Introduction
<center>Dr. Sim is a general learning-based framework that automatically infers similarity measurement that can be used to characterize the transcriptional profile for drug discovery with a generalized well performance. Traditionally, such similarity measurement has been defined empirically in an unsupervised way, while due to the high-dimensionality and the existence of high noise in these high-throughput data, it lacks robustness with limited performance. We evaluated Dr. Sim on the comprehensively publicly available in-vitro and in-vivo datasets in drug annotation and repositioning using the high-throughput transcriptional perturbation data, and indicated that Dr. Sim outperforms the existing methods by two folds, proven to be a conceptual improvement by learning the transcriptional similarity to facilitate the broad utility of the high-throughput transcriptional perturbation data for phenotypic drug discovery.</center>
